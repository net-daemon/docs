title: NetDaemon

This is the application daemon project for Home Assistant. This project makes it possible to make automatons using the .NET 5. The API uses the new nullable types and C# 9.0. Please make your self familiar with these concepts.

Why a new application daemon for Home Assistant? There already exists one!? The existing appdaemon is a great software and are using python as language and ecosystem. This is for people who loves to code in the .NET core ecosystem and c#. The daemon will be supported by all supported platforms of .NET core.

## Two versions of the API

There are currently two versions of the API. Please use the V2 for new projects cause this is to the be default. Version 1 will be deprecated eventually and itÂ´s async features will be migrated into V2. All old V1 is under the V1 docs.

## Expect things to change

:::caution Warning

This is project is in beta stage and API:s can change until release. The project is moving towards first beta where the API:s will be more stable. Please use and contribute ideas for improvement or better yet pull requests.

:::

Only tested on amd64 based architectures like PC or NUC and Raspberry PI 3. Probably works on other architectures too. Will update the docs when I get confirmations from other platforms.

The daemon is currently only distributed through Hassio add-on but a docker container and instruction to run locally will be provided in time.

Please see [the getting started](/docs/started/installation) documentation for setup.

:::info
You need to restart the add-on every time you change a file. C# needs to compile the changes.

## Discuss the NetDaemon

Please [join the Discord server](https://discord.gg/K3xwfcX) to get support or if you want to contribute and help others.

## Async model

The application daemon are built entirely on the async model of .NET. Version one of the API required some knowledge of async/await/Tasks to use it properly. The current version use async with events internally and does not consern the user with async details.

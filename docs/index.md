This is the application daemon project for Home Assistant. This project makes it possible to make automatons using the .NET 5. The API uses the new nullable types and C# 9.0. Please make your self familiar with these concepts.

NetDaemon is a great alternative to appdaemon for people who wants to build their automation logic using .NET 5 ecosystem and C#. The daemon will be supported by all supported platforms of .NET 5.

## Deprecated API V1

There are currently two versions of the API. Please use the V2 for new projects. Version 1 will be deprecated eventually and itÂ´s async features will be migrated into V2. All old V1 is under the V1 docs.

## Stage of project

## Async model

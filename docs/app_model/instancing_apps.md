Instancing applications can be done in several ways. Here is the supported ones by NetDaemon.

### Instancing an application using attribute
Instance any class with the simple attribute like below.
```csharp
[NetDaemonApp]
public class MyApp
{

}
```
If you need to some initialization to be called after the properties are initiaized from the yaml configuration use the `IInitializable` interface.


```csharp
[NetDaemonApp]
public class MyInitializableApp : IInitializable
{
    // syncronous 
    public void Initialize()
    {
        // do some initialization here
    }
}
```
Or async intitialization

```csharp
[NetDaemonApp]
public class MyInitializableApp : IAsyncInitializable
{
    // async 
    public Task InitializeAsync()
    {
        // do some async initialization here
    }
}
```

### Instancing an application using yaml
You can use yaml configuration file to instance apps and provide configuration.

Best way to explain is to provide a yaml config with app class below:

```yaml
light_manager_kitchen: # This is  the id of the app
    class: LightManager # This is the name to the app class full qualified name
    the_light: light.kitchenlightwindow # this is example of custom configuration
```

```csharp

public class LightManager
{
    // This property will be automapped with ´the_light´ config
    // Using autogenerated entity classes in HassModel
    public LightEntity? TheLight { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    ///     Initialize, is automatically run by the daemon
    /// </summary>
    public LightManager()
    {
        // Turn on the light when loading
        TheLight?.TurnOn();
    }
}

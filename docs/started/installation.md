title: Install NetDaemon
---
There are two ways of running NetDaemon, as an add-on running under Home Assistant (previously known as hass.io) or as a docker container.

## Install as a Home Assistant add-on

1. Add the `https://github.com/net-daemon/homeassistant-addon` in `Add new repository URL` to the add-on store.

2. Add the NetDaemon add-on.

If you want to use the autogenerated entities on startup set that setting to true in add-on configuration. It is off default.

3. After you install it, do not start it just yet. We need to configure some stuff manually (will be improved as we come closer to release). See App Development for details.

## Install as a docker container

### Evironment variables you can set
The docker container needs 3 enviroment variables to run properly.

| Env                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| HASS_HOST               | The host that is running Home Assistant (defaults to `localhost`).                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| HASS_PORT               | The port Home Assistant is running on (default to `8123`).                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| HASS_TOKEN              | A Long Lived Acces Token(LLAT) that NetDaemon can use for the comminication with Home Assistant.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| HASS_GEN_ENTITIES       | Defaults to False, set True if you want the autogenerated entities                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| HASS_LOG_LEVEL          | Defaults to info, values are (trace, debug, info, warning, error)                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| TZ                      | You will need to set container time zone to make the scheduler work properly                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| HASS_RUN_PROJECT_FOLDER | HASS_RUN_PROJECT_FOLDER=/data use the csproject file you provides in the netdaemon folder instead of the built-in. This is for advanced scenarios where you want to run custom NUGET packages and compile with your own csproj file. Normally you would not use this. |

### Volumes

| Vol   | description                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| /data | The volume of the netdaemon folder should be mapped to `/data` [See how to setup the correct folder here](installation.md#folder-structure-and-where-to-map-the-docker-volume) |

### Example docker run configuration

```bash
docker run -dt \
  --name netdaemon \
  --restart=always \
  -e HASS_HOST=192.168.1.1 \
  -e HASS_TOKEN=XXXXX \
  -e HASS_GEN_ENTITIES=False \
  -e HASS_LOG_LEVEL=info \
  -e TZ=Europe/Stockholm \
  -v ~/netdaemon_config:/data \
  netdaemon/netdaemon
```
### Folder structure and where to map the docker volume
The `~/netdaemon_config` need to point to the `netdaemon` folder. See image below. The **red arrow** in the example configuration below points to the folder that should be mapped to the `/data`!

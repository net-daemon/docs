title: Get started with NetDaemon app development
---

## 1. Clone the app-template
The easiest way to get started with app development for NetDaemon is to use or clone the [app template repo](https://github.com/net-daemon/netdaemon-app-template). That will give you everything you need to get started developing your first automation.

Example, cloning the template project directly and rename it
```bash
git clone https://github.com/net-daemon/netdaemon-app-template.git
mv netdaemon-app-template netdaemon_apps
cd netdaemon_apps
```
## 2. Enable remote development in devcontainers
If you are using Visual Studio Code, devcontainers are the preferred way to develop your apps. If you are running Visual Studio, skip this step. This also requres docker to be installed.

1. Install [remote Development extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) in VSCode if you have not allready.
2. Open folder, the newly cloned template
3. Run task: `Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container`. Wait until it fully opened 

## 3. Make configurations
NetDaemon development environment needs to be configured to connect to Home Assistant.  Minimal config is: hostname/ip, port and access token. 

1. Rename `_appsettings.json` to `appsettings.json`. 
2. Edit the values in the appsetting `appsettings.json`. Following settings are mandatory:
    - `Host`, the ip or hostname, (port defaults to 8123)
    - `Token`, the long lived access token

Example appsettings file
```json
{
    "Logging": {
        "MinimumLevel": "info"    // debug, trace etc. can be set
    },
    "HomeAssistant": {
        "Host": "your ip",        // ip or hostname to home assistant 
        "Port": 8123,             // port of home assistant (default 8123)
        "Ssl": false,             // true if use SSL to connect to Home Assistant
        "Token": "Your token"     // Home Assistant security token
    },
    "NetDaemon": {
        "AppSource": "./apps",     // path to apps directory
        "GenerateEntities": false // generates entity helpers on start
    }
}
```

## Develop and debug your apps
Now properly configured you can develop your application. The template shows example of both develop and test your apps. A sample app has been provided for you: `src/apps/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.cs`.

Debug and run your apps and view log output for errors.

## Deploy your apps

After you have developed and tested your apps it is time to deploy and run the apps in the production environment. That's what we will look at next...

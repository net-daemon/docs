It is also possible to get applications through [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/). This is still early so you will have to get the latest version of HACS and uninstall and install it again if you have already configured through GUI.

Here is [detailed instructions](https://hacs.xyz/docs/categories/netdaemon_apps) how to enable getting NetDaemon apps through HACS

## Contribute own apps through HACS

There are still not many apps available yet but please if you can contribute apps there are a [template here](https://github.com/net-daemon/netdaemon-app-template).

[Instructions for developing apps for HACS here](https://hacs.xyz/docs/publish/netdaemon)

To deploy HAC apps the default runtime is supported. Custom projects or published binaries is currently not supported.

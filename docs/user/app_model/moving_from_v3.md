title: Moving from NetDaemon version 3
---

This documentation how to upgrade and move to current .NET 7 based NetDaemon runtime v3.x to .NET 8 based NetDaemon runtime 4. There are some breaking issues but should be quite straight forward upgrade your applications and runtime environment.

# Development environment

:::info

We try to always keep NetDaemon up-to-date with the latest versions of .NET. Since we are a small team of maintainers we can not maintain more than one version at a time. This is why new features never is added to old versions. We recommend users to update their apps when ever a new major version of NetDaemon.

:::

The following changes have to be executed in order to develop your apps for NetDaemon 4 and .NET 8.

## 1. Update nuget packages

In this release we decided to change naming of NetDaemon nuget packages. The names are basically the same but without the `JoySoftware`. The reason is we needed to make sure we got the ownership of the NetDaemon id on our nuget packages for security reasons.

1. In all .NET project files `*.csproj`, rename all nuget references that starts with `JoySoftware.NetDaemon` to `NetDaemon`. For users that uses the source deploy option you will have to add the`NetDaemon.AppModel.SourceDeployedApps` nuget package!
2. Change the target framework to 8.0
3. Update Microsoft .NET references in your C# files to the corresponding .NET 8 versions

### 2. Update docker containers and add-ons

The docker container, change the name from `netdaemon3` to `netdaemon4`. All other settings are the same.

If you are using the addon write down the current settings in your current 3.x based addon and install the version 4 version and update settings as needed. In version 4 the default path had changed from `config/netdaemon3` to `config/netdaemon4`.

### 3. Update the code generator

As some of the namespaces have changed you should update your locally installed version of the [Code generator](/user/hass_model/hass_model_codegen.md) by running the following command:

```bash
dotnet tool install -g NetDaemon.HassModel.CodeGen
```

:::warning

You may need to uninstall the old code generator by using the `dotnet tool uninstall -g JoySoftware.NetDaemon.HassModel.CodeGen` command. Since we have changed
the namespace there will be conflicting tool command names.

:::

...and then re-run the generator to create an updated version of `HomeAssistantGenerated.cs`

### 4. Update the CLI tool

As some of the namespaces have changed you should first uninstall the cli tool by `dotnet new uninstall JoySoftware.NetDaemon.Templates.Project`
and then install the new too by 

```bash
dotnet new --install NetDaemon.Templates.Project

```

The application model is the information and services that are handled by the NetDaemon runtime related to the application instance. Instancing an app is the first step to starting your automations in NetDaemon.

## Instancing applications

To instance an app you just have to use the `[NetDaemonApp]` attribute on any class and the NetDaemon runtime will instance it and run it.

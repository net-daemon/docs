title: Install NetDaemon integration
---

Using the NetDaemon custom integration enables you to

- Have service callbacks from Home Assistant to your code
- Create and update entities that survive restarts

It is highly recommended to use this integration. The new integration requires NetDaemon 21.00.0 or higher to work.
<!-- 
We now support persistent entities for [SetState](/docs/api/api_state#set-state-of-custom-entities) on the following domains:
- `binary_sensor`
- `sensor`
- `switch`
- `climate` -->

<!-- Other domains [SetState](/docs/api/api_state#set-state-of-custom-entities) will create but not be persisted when restarted. You can also see warnings in logs using other domains. -->

## Installation

We recommend to install it through [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) to always have an updated version of the component. You can download it manually if you want.

1. Add `https://github.com/net-daemon/integration` with the category "integration" as a custom repository in [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories)
2. Install it in HACS
3. Clear browser cache and restart Home Assistant
4. Go to Configuration -> Integrations -> + -> Search for "NetDaemon" and install it.

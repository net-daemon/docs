## What do I need to get started?
Here is what you will need to start developing apps to automate your home with NetDaemon:

- The hostname/ip-address and port of your Home Assistant instance
- Have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed to get the development template
- Create an access token to use for authorization. The long lived access token is created under your profile in the Home Assistant GUI. Make sure the user account for this access token has Administrator privileges in Home Assistant
- Have a .NET development environment. You can edit .cs files in any tool, but using a development environment is recommended
  - [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)
  - [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0) installed (if running in devcontainer with VSCode, it is pre-installed)
  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed if you want to use devcontainer in VSCode (recommended)

Now you have all you need to develop an app, lets just do that by moving to App development.

## What version do I want to use?
All new users should use version 3 of the runtime! Version 2 will be deprecated and removed.

## NetDaemon 2
Version 2 is the old version and has both API:s of HassModel (dependency injected) and baseclass. 

## NetDaemon 3
Version 3 is a new runtime developed from the start with an  architecture built on top of dependency injection. This model only supports HassModel API for automations. This is still en beta and are more likely to have API changes. The NetDaemon V3 has breaking changes fro V2. It uses different namespaces and the configuration using yaml is redesigned using dependecy injection.

## The file structure

All automation files are in the `netdaemon` folder directly under your configuration folder. Typically you access these files within VS Code or any other editor. Your root directory in your editor should look something like this.:

![](/img/docs/started/rootdir.png)

## Get intellisense

Before coding, run the `dotnet restore` to get intellisense.

## Code snippets

We provide some code snippets to create a new app. Check it out.. In vscode, in the cs code file press `ctrl+space` and select.. More will come later.

## Read up on System.Reactive

The observable model is really powerful. Learn the model and you can do great things with the V2 of the API. Please study the [System.Reactive](http://introtorx.com/) APIs and what you can do with it!

## Get current state

NetDaemon keeps track of states in the background. Getting state is not doing a networking call. States are dynamic values calculated from origin value like double->int->bool->string... The "unavailable" state are null value of the State.

```csharp
string? state = State("light.light1")?.State;
if (state is object)
{
    // Not null
    ...
}

// Get state attributes, returns null if not exist
var brightness = State("light.light1").Attribute?.brightness;

```

## State changes

The API let you manage state very easy. This is based on the System.Reactive. I will only do basic things here but please read up on [System.Reactive](http://introtorx.com/) to learn the true power of this way of handling events.

Let´s start with a very basic example. If the motion sensors state turns to "on", turn on the `light.light1` light. .

```csharp
Entity("binary_sensor.my_motion_sensor")
    .StateChanges
    .Where(e.New?.State == "on")
    .Subscribe(s => Entity("light.light1").TurnOn());
```

So what is going on here? First statement, `Entity("binary_sensor.my_motion_sensor")` selects the entity you want track changes from. The `Where(e.New?.State == "on")` tracks state changes for new events that are getting the state `on`. And finally, `Subscribe(e => Entity("light.light1").TurnOn()` subscribes to the changes and calls the code if the where clause is met. In this case it calls turn on service on the light entity. `StateChanges`checks if the `New.State != Old.State`. To get all changes including the attribute changes, please use `StateAllChanges` instead of `StateChanges`.

If the `from` state is important then use it like:

```csharp
Entity("binary_sensor.my_motion_sensor")
    .StateChanges
    .Where(e.New?.State == "on" && e.Old?.State == "off")
    .Subscribe(s => Entity("light.light1").TurnOn());
```

Or even more advanced example. You can use any combination of state and attributes or even external methods in the lambda expressions. Here is an example: When sun elevation below 3.0 and not rising and old state elevation is above 3.0 then we should turn on light. This uses the `StateAllChanges` since we want all changes to the elevation attribute.

```csharp
Entity("sun.sun")
    .StateAllChanges
    .Where(e =>
        e.New?.Attribute?.elevation <= 3.0 &&
        e.New?.Attribute?.rising == false &&
        e.Old?.Attribute?.elevation > 3.0)
    .Subscribe(s =>
    {
        // Do some logic and stuff here.
        Entity("light.light1").TurnOn();

    });
```

### Use the observable stream directly
The `Entity/Entities` notation is just a shortcut for the observable stream of state changes. You can use the observable directly. Like this example, selects all events where any entity is turned on.

```csharp
    StateChanges // or StateAllChanges
        .Where(e => e.New?.State == "on")
        .Subscribe(s =>...);

```

### Wait for state in blocking mode
Sometimes you want to control the flow in a blocking way to manage a sequence of events. Then we have the `NDFirstOrTimeout` extension method on Observalbe.

The snippet below waits for the first occurence of `binary_sensor.pir` to change any state but times out if it does not change state within 300ms. **Remember that you cannot use blocking functions in Initialize function directly.** In most cases that would not make sense anyway.
```csharp
var res = Entity("binary_sensor.pir").StateChanges.NDFirstOrTimeout(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(300));
if (res is null)
{
    // timed out
}
else
{
    // use res.New?.State... or whatever
}
```

## Set state of custom entities
It is possible to set state of entities that are not in Home Assistant. If the entity does not exist, Home Assistant will create it. You can create any non existing entity this way but if you want the entity to behave like a normal entity and be persisted you should use the [NetDaemon integration](/docs/started/integration).
```csharp
   SetState("sensor.custom", "on", new { attr = "myattr" });
```

## Using Areas

NetDaemon does match the area where the entity´s device is configured. This means it is very easy to do selections on what area that matches.

All binary sensors (PIRS) in the kitchen turn on the light:

```csharp
Entities(n => n.Area == "kitchen" && n.EntityId.StartsWith("binary_sensor."))
    .StateChanges
    .Where(e=> e.New.?State == "on")
    .Subscribe(s =>
    {
        // Turn on all lights in area kitchen
        Entities(n => n.Area == "kitchen" && n.EntityId.StartsWith("light.")).TurnOn();
    });
```

# Introducing the HassModel API
This is the experimental API that is the future of NetDaemon. We are moving towards a more "C# friendly" API using constructs that are more common for C# developers. The current API will be around long enough for reasonable adoption. This API introduces alot of great stuff like not need to have a yaml file to initialize an app. The new code generated code is much more usefull with entities generated for all the domains and extension methods for all services.

We will add more docs and samples as we get closer to release.

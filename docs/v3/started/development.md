title: Get started with NetDaemon app development

## 1. Get the project template
There are two ways you can get the template. If you want to use GitHub you can clone the template. If you prefer the dotnet cli there is a template for it you can install. Watch the small introduction video how to get the project template using the cli tool.

### Clone the app-template
One way get started with app development for NetDaemon 3 is to use or clone the [app template repo](https://github.com/net-daemon/netdaemon-app-template) and use the branch `v3`. That will give you everything you need to get started developing your first automation.


Example, cloning the template project, check out v3 branch and rename it
```bash
git clone https://github.com/net-daemon/netdaemon-app-template.git
mv netdaemon-app-template netdaemon_apps
cd netdaemon_apps
git checkout v3
```
### Use dotnet cli tool
The other way to get a template to start with is to install the dotnet cli tool.
```bash
dotnet new --install JoySoftware.NetDaemon.Templates.Project
mkdir NetDaemonApps
cd NetDaemonApps
dotnet new nd-project
```
## 2. Configure your development tool

### 2.1 Visual Studio
You should be all set, so skip to step 3

### 2.2 Visual Studio Code
If you are using Visual Studio Code, devcontainers are the preferred way to develop your apps. This also requires docker to be installed.

1. Install [remote Development extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) in VSCode if you have not already.
2. Open folder, the newly cloned template
3. Run task: `Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container`. Wait until it fully opened

### 2.3 JetBrains Rider
Rider supports debugging of containerized ASP.Net Core apps from version 2018.2.

Open the netdaemon_app folder in Rider and it should be able to build the projects immediately.
A default execute and debug profile will be created however these will be executed as local processes.
The preferred way to develop your app is to use devcontainers, which requires docker to be installed.
To configure devcontainers, perform the following steps:

1. Locate `Dockerfile` in the Solution Explorer window
2. Right click and select `Debug Dockerfile`
3. This will create a new profile called "DOCKERFILE"
4. To view progress, located "Docker" in the "Services" tab and double-click it
5. Like all container apps, the first build may take a few minutes - watch the progress in the "Services / Docker" tab

Ensure that the "DOCKERFILE" profile is selected in the toolbar and then `Run` and `Debug` will execute within the container.

## 3. Make configurations
NetDaemon development environment needs to be configured to connect to Home Assistant.  Minimal config is: hostname/ip, port and access token.

1. Rename `_appsettings.json` to `appsettings.json`.
2. Edit the values in the appsetting `appsettings.json`. Following settings are mandatory:
   - `Host`, the ip or hostname, (port defaults to 8123)
   - `Token`, the long lived access token

Example appsettings file
```json
{
   "Logging": {
      "LogLevel": {
         "Default": "Debug",  // Set the loglevel
         "Microsoft": "Warning"
      },
      "ConsoleThemeType": "Ansi" // The theme, Ansi or System
   },
   "HomeAssistant": {
      "Host": "your ip",        // ip or hostname to home assistant 
      "Port": 8123,             // port of home assistant (default 8123)
      "Ssl": false,             // true if use SSL to connect to Home Assistant
      "Token": "Your token"     // Home Assistant security token
   },
   "NetDaemon": {
         "ApplicationConfigurationFolder": "./apps" //Only change if you change app folder
   }
}
```

## Develop and debug your apps
Now properly configured you can develop your application. The template shows example of both develop and test your apps. A sample app has been provided for you: `src/apps/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.cs`.

Debug and run your apps and view log output for errors.

## Deploy your apps

After you have developed and tested your apps it is time to deploy and run the apps in the production environment. That's what we will look at next...

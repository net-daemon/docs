# Introducing the HassModel API
HassModel is the new NetDaemon API that is the future of NetDaemon. This API introduces alot of great stuff like not need to have a yaml file to initialize an app. The new generated code is much more useful with entities generated for all the domains and extension methods for all services.

:::caution Warning
We do currently consider this API to be a 'Preview'. It has proven to be stable and we use it extensively in our own home automations. We might however introduce breaking changes to this API based on your feedback and our own experience.
:::


The previous 'V2 API' will be around long enough for reasonable adoption of HassModel.

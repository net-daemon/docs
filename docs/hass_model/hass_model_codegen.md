title: Using the Code generator
---

NetDaemon has a generator that creates code based on the Entities and services in Home Assistant. This makes it possible to navigate all Entities and Services using intellisense.

The code generator is installed as a [.NET global tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools) via the following command:

```
dotnet tool install -g JoySoftware.NetDaemon.HassModel.CodeGen
```

*While in preview, it is required to include the -version of the most recent version explicitly. Please check
https://www.nuget.org/packages/JoySoftware.NetDaemon.HassModel.CodeGen/ for the latest version*

After it is installed as a global tool it can be run with the command:

`
nd-codegen
`

When the tool is run from the folder of your NetDaemon project that contains an `appsettings.json` or `appsettings.development.json` file it will automatically use the connection settings from that config file to connect to Home Assistant. It will output a single file `HomeAssistantGenerated.cs` that contains all the generated code.

The generated code contains the following:

* A class `Entities` that provides properties to navigate to all existing entities in Home Assistant via intellisense
* A record derived from `Entity` for each domain that has entities in Home Assistant
* A record with all the attributes of all entities in a specific domain, so they can be accessed via typed properties
* A class `Services` that provides access to all services in Home Assistant via their domain
* Extension methods for each service that takes an entity as a target

## Commandline arguments

The settings for the code generator can also be set from the command line, this will override the settings from a configuration file if it is present.
